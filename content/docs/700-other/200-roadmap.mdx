[See here](https://stackbit.notion.site/Contentlayer-Roadmap-ca6d21d6a1424b11b11692d6356c1ff7) for our roadmap.

This list is not exhaustive, but meant to provide visibility into our high-level priorities.

## Adding Items to Roadmap

To add something to the roadmap, first check [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues) for a relevant topic. Feel free to comment to ask for an updated status.

If you don't see a relevant topic, [create one](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/new).

## Roadmap States

The roadmap shows each item in one of four states:

- **Considering:** We're actively talking about the topic, but have not yet prioritized it.
- **Planned:** We plan to work on these items as we release those currently in progress. These items are subject to change.
- **In Progress:** Work is being done against the topic.
- **Released:** The feature/change has been released in a new version.
