<div className="rounded-md border border-yellow-100 bg-yellow-50 px-6 dark:border-orange-500/50 dark:bg-orange-500/20">
  âš  The content source plugin `contentlayer-source-notion` is currently in Alpha and should not be used in production.
</div>

The `contentlayer-source-notion` uses [`@notion-render/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notion-render/client) under the hood to transform your Rich text content (Rich Text properties and pages content) into HTML that you can then use and style in your app.

## Install `@notion-render/client`

Run the following command to add `@notion-render/client` to your dependencies:

```text
npm install @notion-render/client
```

## Configure the renderer

Notion Rich Text is basically a list of blocks, each block has a `type` (e.g. image) and contains its configuration (e.g. the image url).

Each block has its own renderer called `block renderer` that takes in input the configuration and returns a string (the generated HTML).

You can find the list of block types on the [Official Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block).

### Create block renderer

You can create a block renderer by using the `createBlockRenderer` function.
The first parameter is the type of block, the second is the function used to render this type of block.

When a block has children, you can use the renderer instance to render them.

```typescript
import { createBlockRenderer } from '@syneki/notion-render'

const paragraphRenderer = createBlockRenderer<ParagraphBlockObjectResponse>('paragraph', async (data, renderer) => {
  return `<p>${await renderer.render(...data.paragraph.rich_text)}</p>`
})
```

### Add the block renderer

You can add your block renderers directly in the constructor parameters or with the method `addBlockRenderer`.

```typescript
import { makeSource } from 'contentlayer-source-notion'

// or
renderer.addBlockRenderer(paragraphRenderer)

export default makeSource({
  client,
  renderer: {
    renderers: [paragraphRenderer],
  },
})
```
