excerpt: Use the next-contentlayer plugin to tightly integrate Contentlayer into a Next.js project.
---

Contentlayer has full support for Next.js projects, including live reloading (if you follow the recommended approach below).

## Installation & Configuration

Using Contentlayer in a Next.js project is easiest if you use the [`next-contentlayer`](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer) plugin. Install the plugin:

```txt
npm install next-contentlayer
```

Then wrap your next configuration object in the [`withContentlayer` utility](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer#withcontentlayer).

```js
// next.config.js
import { withContentlayer } from 'next-contentlayer'
export default withContentlayer({})
```

## App Directory

Contentlayer is now optimized for use with React server components (RSC) within the `app` directory, which was introduced in Next 13. Learn more in [the Next beta docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata).

### Server vs Client components

At this time, we recommend using Contentlayer with server components.

Using Contentlayer data with [client components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components) is likely to require users to download data from the entire page. Unless solving a specific need that requires Contentlayer, we recommend using server components.

### Contentlayer Beta

Both Contentlayer and Next.js 13 are currently in beta. This means that there are likely edge cases that we have not yet accounted for. If you run into any issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/new).

We recommend using the latest beta versions of both packages to stay upstream of any resolved issues.

[Join the Discord community](https://discord.gg/rytFErsARm) to discuss any issues you run into and to stay up to date on the latest developments and releases.

### Known Issues

There are a few known issues with using Contentlayer in the `app` directory:

- Infinite looping issue when calling `cache()` in client components. [See here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42180#issuecomment-1303451294)
- Build failure when using Yarn PnP. [See here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42427)

## Working with Images

Image processing with Contentlayer is not currently supported, although we're planning on it. The current recommendation is to place images in the `public` directory, and then use a `string` field to store the path to that image.

Alternatively, you can store your images in an asset service like Cloudinary or Imgix. [See here for more detail](/docs/sources/files/images) on our current recommendation for image processing.

### Using next/image in Body Content

If you want to use `next/image` to render your images, create a component to wrap `next/image` and add the image via component markup in your markdown or MDX file.

For example, say we have an `Image` component in our project that wraps the `next/image`.

```jsx
import NextImage from 'next/image'

const Image = (props) => {
  return <NextImage /* ... */ />
}
```

Your content should then call this component directly.

```md
Other markdown content ...

<Image src="..." />
```

You can either use an `.mdx` file to have this content processed automatically, or you can use a tool like [`markdown-to-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) with raw markdown.

## Content live-reload (HMR)

Content live reload should work out-of-the-box with Next.js when using the `next-contentlayer` plugin and importing your content (e.g. `import { allPosts } from 'contentlayer/generated'`) directly in your page app/components.

However, in some cases (due to a bug in Next.js) you might need to add the following hook to your app/page components:

```tsx
import { useLiveReload } from 'next-contentlayer/hooks'
import { allPosts } from 'contentlayer/generated'

export function MyPage() {
  useLiveReload() // this only runs during development and has no impact on production

  return <div>Your app</div>
}
```

## Using TypeScript

Using TypeScript with Next.js is optional, but [we _highly_ recommend it](/docs/concepts/type-safety).

Next.js works great with TypeScript. [Their docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) show how to add TypeScript to new and existing projects. It also lists useful types provided by Next.js.

### Using Preact

Preact can be used with a custom Webpack config. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/62) for details.
