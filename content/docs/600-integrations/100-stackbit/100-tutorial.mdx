excerpt: Learn how to use Stackbit and Contentlayer to add visual editing to a Next.js application.

We can demonstrate how this works through a simple example. In this scenario, we have a `Page` model with a required `title` field.

The content lives in a `content/pages` directory, and we want to use each page's file path as the URL path to that page, which we'll store in a computed `urlPath` property on the compiled data (via the Contentlayer build process).

Let's assume:

- The content is stored in markdown files in a `content/pages` directory. (Note that only files-source is supported by this approach.)
- We're using Next.js as the site framework, which is the primary framework for which Contentlayer is optimized.

## Setup

First, make sure the dependencies are installed in the project:

```txt
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer @contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit
```

## Stackbit Configuration

In Stackbit, document type definitions are referred to as _models_ and are defined using [the `models` property](https://docs.stackbit.com/reference/config/content-modeling/models).

A simple Stackbit config might look something like this:

```ts
// stackbit.config.ts

import type * as Stackbit from '@stackbit/sdk'

const stackbitConfig: Stackbit.RawConfig = {
  stackbitVersion: '~0.6.0',
  cmsName: 'git',
  ssgName: 'nextjs',
  nodeVersion: '16',
  dataDir: 'content/data',
  pagesDir: 'content/pages',
  models: {
    Page: {
      type: 'page',
      hideContent: true,
      urlPath: '/{slug}',
      fields: [
        {
          type: 'string',
          name: 'title',
          default: 'This is a new page',
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}

export default stackbitConfig
```

<Callout>
  Note that best practice generally leads to breaking up each object in the `models` property into individual files, but
  are combined here for context.
</Callout>

## Extend Models

In the Contentlayer configuration file, we can import the Stackbit config, and then add our computed `urlPath` property.

```ts
import { stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes } from '@contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit'
import stackbitConfig from './stackbit.config.js'

const documentTypes = stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes(stackbitConfig, {
  documentTypes: {
    Page: {
      computedFields: {
        url: {
          type: 'string',
          resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.flattenedPath.replace(/^pages\/?/, '/'),
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout>
  Notice that we didn't have to define the `title` field. We also didn't have to define properties like `name` or
  `filePathPattern` on the models, as they were already inferred by this function.
</Callout>

## Configure the Source

At this point, we have everything we need to call `makeSource` and start using Contentlayer build output from Stackbit configuration.

```ts
import { makeSource } from '@contentlayer/source-files'
import { stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes } from '@contentlayer/experimental-source-files-stackbit'
import stackbitConfig from './stackbit.config.js'

const documentTypes = stackbitConfigToDocumentTypes(stackbitConfig, {
  // document type extensions ...
})

export default makeSource({ contentDirPath: 'content', documentTypes })
```

Now you can build files by running `contentlayer build` in your project!

<Callout>
  We recommend using [`withContentlayer`](/docs/reference/next-contentlayer#withcontentlayer) when using Next.js to run
  `contentlayer dev` in sync with `next dev`.
