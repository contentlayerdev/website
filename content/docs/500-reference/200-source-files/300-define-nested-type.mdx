excerpt: Technical reference for defining a nested document type schema.
---

`defineNestedType` defines the schema for a reusable shape of data that can be embedded within documents.

Nested types are defined within document type definitions, and therefore do not have to be included in the [`makeSource` options](/docs/reference/source-files/make-source).

## Usage

```js
const SEO = defineNestedType(() => ({
  name: 'SEO',
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
    },
  },
}))

const Doc = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Doc',
  filePathPattern: '**/*.md',
  fields: {
    // ...
    seo: {
      type: 'nested',
      of: SEO,
    },
  },
}))
```

## Options

### `name` (required)

Name of the document. This defines the types and functions that are generated for documents of this type.

```js
const SEO = defineNestedType(() => ({
  name: "SEO",
  // ...
})
```

Because nested types are not documents, they are not exported as individual data files. But a type definition will still be generated (as `SEO` in the usage example).

### `fields`

Field definitions determine the data shape for the document type. See [the field types reference](/docs/reference/source-files/field-types) for more information.

### `description`

Provides a description for the generated type definition.
